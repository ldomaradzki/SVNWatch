SVNWatch
========
Quick project to build tray application to monitor SVN commits. 
SVNWatch uses Notification Center introduced in OSX 10.8 to announce about new commit in SVN repository.

Because NSPopover isn't working properly (there's a known bug with textFields inside popover) I had to 
use pasteboard to provide way to change URL.
